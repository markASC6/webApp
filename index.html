                        When people see a story that makes them feel a strong emotion, they don’t stop to verify if it is true. Their immediate instinct is to share it with their friends or with their followers. This adds credibility to the fake story and leads their followers to share it too. Before anyone realizes a story is fake, hundreds of people may have shared it and been enraged, shocked, or terrified by it. Verify your news before you share it.
